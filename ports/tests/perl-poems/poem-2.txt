There once was a language called Perl,
Whose syntax could make programmers hurl.
With sigils and refs,
It puzzles the clefs,
But gets the job done, truth to tell.

The camel's odd symbols abound,
While $_ and @f shift around.
Context-sensitive,
It makes programmers gripe,
Yet CPAN's gems can still be found.
