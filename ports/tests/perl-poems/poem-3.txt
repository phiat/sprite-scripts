O Perl, you duct tape of the internet,
Your Swiss army chainsaw cuts through problems.
Larry Wall's creation speaks human thoughts,
"There's more than one way to do it" echoes through time.

Your sigils dance like dollar signs and at-signs,
Context-aware and flexible as water.
CPAN's treasure trove expands endlessly,
Modules for every need, every desire.

From sysadmin scripts to bioinformatics,
You adapt, you transform, you persist.
Thirty years strong, still relevant, still powerful,
Perl, the practical extraction wizard.
