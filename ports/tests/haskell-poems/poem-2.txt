A programmer named Haskell McGee
Found his code would not compile, you see
With monads and functors
And type class conductors
He cried "What does this syntax decree?"

But soon he embraced the pure way
Where side effects could not stray
With lazy evaluation
And type validation
His programs ran perfectly each day
