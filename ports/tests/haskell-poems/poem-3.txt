Oh Haskell, elegant language of the mind,
Where pure functions flow like rivers of thought.
Your lazy evaluation holds secrets untold,
Computations deferred until the moment they're sought.
Pattern matching dances across your concise syntax,
Type inference guides us with mathematical grace.
From the Glasgow Compiler to cabal's embrace,
You stand as a fortress against programming's race.
Functional paradigm, crystal clear and precise,
In your immutable world, bugs find no home.
May your influence grow, may your wisdom suffice,
As we write programs that never grow old.
