O F#, you elegant language of the .NET realm
Where functions dance like poetry in the compiler's dream
Your pipe operators flow like rivers through code
Immutable data structures stand firm against time's tide
Discriminated unions tell stories of possibility
Pattern matching weaves logic like tapestry
Type inference reads the programmer's mind
Computation expressions build worlds within worlds
From Microsoft's research labs to production's embrace
You bring functional purity to the enterprise space
A symphony of safety, beauty, and purpose
F#, you are the quiet revolution in code
