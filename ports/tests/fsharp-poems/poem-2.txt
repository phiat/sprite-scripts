An F# coder from Doncaster town
Loved pipes that would flow up and down
With |> he'd compose
Through functions he'd close
While mutability wore a deep frown

His unions were discriminated so well
Pattern matching would cast its sweet spell
Immutability kept
All bugs neatly swept
Making F# code ring like a bell
