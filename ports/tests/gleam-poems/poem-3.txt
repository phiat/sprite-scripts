Oh Gleam, you rise like morning light,
A beacon in the functional night.
Your types flow strong and clear,
No null to cause us fear,
Just pure expressions burning bright.

You dance on Erlang's ancient stage,
Yet write in this modern age.
Pattern matching guides the way,
Actors work and play,
A language that truly engages.

Your compiler gentle yet so firm,
Guiding hands to help us learn.
In the BEAM you find your home,
No longer code to roam,
Gleam, the modern concern.
