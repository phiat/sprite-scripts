There once was a language called Gleam,
With functional programming as its theme.
No null values in sight,
Just pattern matches so bright,
Making concurrency quite a dream.

Its types flow like a magical stream,
While the BEAM VM keeps the code clean.
With Erlang beneath,
It runs without grief,
A modern functional coding scheme.
