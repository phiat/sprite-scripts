A coder from Cupertino named Tim
Found Swift's syntax quite positively prim
But optionals made him curse
"Force unwrap!" - what's worse?
His app crashed right on a limb.

The compiler then shouted with glee
"You forgot nil safety, you see!"
So Tim learned with great care
To handle with ? flair
Now his Swift apps run bug-free.
