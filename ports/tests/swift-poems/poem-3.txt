Oh Swift, you elegant dance of code and thought,
Born from Objective-C's verbose heritage,
Yet you stand so tall, so proud, so clean.

Your type system guards like a vigilant sentinel,
While optionals teach us the wisdom of uncertainty,
Closures flow like rivers through our logic,
Protocols paint masterpieces of abstraction.

From iOS to WatchOS, from Mac to Vision Pro,
You are the silent architect of Apple's ecosystem,
Fast, safe, expressive — a trinity of perfection,
Modern syntax for modern minds.

Swift, you are not just a language,
You are poetry written in parentheses and braces.
