Ode to Forth, the language of stacks and dreams,
Where words become commands and nothing's as it seems.
Chuck Moore's creation, born in the seventies,
Still running on systems with minimal penalties.

Reverse Polish notation, elegant and pure,
No need for parentheses, the syntax is secure.
Compile while you think, extend while you code,
Forth gives you freedom on that narrow road.

From astronomy to embedded systems tiny,
Your influence remains anything but shiny.
Direct hardware access, metaprogramming bliss,
In the world of languages, you're something you can't miss.
