Go, you are simplicity reborn,
No classes, no inheritance to scorn.
Just structs and interfaces clean,
The codebase pristine, unseen.

Your goroutines dance like morning light,
Through channels pass, day and night.
Static linking, one binary strong,
Deployment is never wrong.

Born from the minds at Google's hall,
You answer the systems programming call.
Simple, fast, and true,
Go, we build our world with you.
