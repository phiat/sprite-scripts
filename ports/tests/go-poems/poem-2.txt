A programmer named Rob from Google's crew
Built a language that's fresh and new
With goroutines so fast
And channels that last
The old C++ code bid adieu

But gofmt makes all code look the same
While error handling remains quite a game
You must check nil, nil, err
Which might make programmers swear
Yet Go still powers systems with flame
