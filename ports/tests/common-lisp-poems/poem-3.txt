O Common Lisp, you ancient soul of code,
Where symbols dance and parentheses embrace.
Your heart beats strong with lambda functions pure,
Your macros bend the world to their design.

The REPL whispers secrets of the machine,
While CAR and CDR traverse lists with grace.
You gave us CLOS, your object-oriented dream,
Yet kept your functional and simple face.

Decades have passed since MIT first saw your light,
Yet still you stand unbroken, proud, and free.
No language matches your transcendent might,
In code itself, you've set the spirit free.
