There once was a language called Lisp,
Whose parenthetical style made some gasp,
But with macros so grand,
It could twist and command,
Making new syntax right there on the spot.

The REPL would just dance and reply,
As coders would laugh and would sigh,
With defun and let,
They'd solve problems set,
In a way that would make other languages cry.
