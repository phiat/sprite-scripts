O, C language, born in seventies light,
You gave us the power to write with such might.
From Bell Labs you emerged, simple and clean,
The foundation for systems yet to be seen.

Your curly braces embrace every thought,
Your semicolons mark where each line is caught.
With structs and unions, we build our own types,
While header files keep our code in its stripes.

You run on the metal, close to the core,
No garbage collector, no runtime to bore.
From kernels to embedded, you stand ever true,
Fifty years strong, still fresh and still new.
