A programmer named Guido once said,
"Let's make code flow right from the head!"
With spaces not tabs,
No curly-brab cabs,
And duck typing fills souls with dread.

The GIL locks threads one at a time,
While pip installs packages divine.
But who really cares?
When Python declares,
"Readability counts, and it's fine!"
