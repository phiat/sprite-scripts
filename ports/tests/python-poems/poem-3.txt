O Python, you elegant serpent of code,
Where whitespace becomes poetry and logic flows.
Batteries included, a philosophy complete,
From web Django dances to data NumPy beats.

You whisper simplicity in every line,
Yet power lurks beneath your gentle design.
Zen of Python guides us, clear and true,
import antigravity when we need to breakthrough.

Thirty years strong, yet ever-evolving still,
A language that humans can actually read—what a thrill!
