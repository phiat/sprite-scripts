There once was a language called OCaml
Whose syntax could make you quite frantic
With semicolons strict
And pipes that conflict
But its type system was truly romantic

A programmer from France loved OCaml
Though its quirks made him sometimes feel frantic
The module system grand
In this functional land
Made his code both robust and ecstatic
