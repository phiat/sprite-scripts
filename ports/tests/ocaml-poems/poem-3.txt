OCaml, you dance with types and grace,
Where inference guides the programmer's pace.
Your functional heart beats pure and strong,
Immutable data where nothing goes wrong.

From INRIA's labs you emerged so bright,
A language that makes everything right.
Pattern matching flows like poetry,
Modules and functors set thinking free.

Jane Street embraced you for finance and trade,
Your performance never starts to fade.
Compiler warnings catch every mistake,
Safety and speed is the path you take.
