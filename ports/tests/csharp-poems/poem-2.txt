There once was a coder named Pat,
Who thought C# was rather quite neat,
With LINQ so concise,
And async twice as nice,
The CLR made their code complete.

The properties auto-implemented,
While generics kept types prevented,
With await and async,
The code stayed distinct,
C# features left them contented.
