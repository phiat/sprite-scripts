Ode to C#, the language of elegance,
Where curly braces dance and semicolons stand tall.
Born from Microsoft's vision in 2000,
A child of Java, yet uniquely its own.

Strong typing guides us like a steady hand,
While the Common Language Runtime breathes life into our bytes.
LINQ flows like poetry across collections,
Async/await paints futures in pastel hues.

From desktop apps to cloud services bright,
From Unity games to enterprise might,
C# stands as a pillar of modern code,
A symphony of features, perfectly composed.
