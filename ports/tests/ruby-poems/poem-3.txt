Ruby, you elegant language of the rising sun,
Where everything is an object, every method a song.
Your blocks dance like cherry blossoms in spring,
Your gems sparkle like stars in the night sky.
Matz dreamed you into existence with love,
A programmer's best friend, a developer's delight.
Your syntax reads like poetry, your flexibility knows no bounds,
From Rails to scripts, you make coding feel like coming home.
