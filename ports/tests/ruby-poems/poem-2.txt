There once was a language called Ruby,
Whose code flowed like honey so lovely.
With blocks and with yield,
It made coding a thrill,
And gems made the journey quite comfy.

Its objects all danced with such grace,
No types stood in memory's space.
Monkey-patching brought fun,
Until morning was done,
In this dynamic, flexible place.
