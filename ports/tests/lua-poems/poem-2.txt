A quirky language named Lua
Felt quite constrained by its syntax, "Ooh-a!"
But its tables so grand
Made developers stand
In awe of its flexible tricks, "Woo-hoo!"

The C API though quite terse
Made embedding feel like a curse
Yet its speed and its grace
Won the programming race
Now Lua's the best, getting better, not worse!
