O Lua, you elegant simplicity,
Born in Brazil, now global in your reach.
Your tables, both arrays and maps combined,
Your coroutines dance in concurrent time.
One-based indexing, a curious choice,
Yet somehow feels right in your design.
Embedded deep in engines, games, and tools,
You prove that small can be mighty indeed.
From Nginx to World of Warcraft's core,
Your footprint light, your impact profound.
