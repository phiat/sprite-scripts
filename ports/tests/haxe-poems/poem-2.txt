There once was a language called Haxe,
That compiled in so many ways.
To JavaScript, C++, or Flash,
It would dash with a crash,
And saved developers countless long days.

Now Haxe has its quirks, it is true,
With syntax that's fresh and quite new.
The macros are powerful,
The conditional logic is wonderful,
Making cross-platform dreams finally come true.
