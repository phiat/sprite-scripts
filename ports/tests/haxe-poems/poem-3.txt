Ode to Haxe, the chameleon of code,
You speak many tongues yet remain one soul.
From Neko to JavaScript, C++ to PHP,
You bridge platforms where others cannot be.

Your type system dances with static grace,
While your macros bend time and space.
Heaps of Haxe, the community strong,
Where open source hearts belong.

Born in France, now global in reach,
You teach us that code need not preach
To a single platform, but can roam free,
Across devices, for all to see.
