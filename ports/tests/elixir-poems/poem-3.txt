Ode to Elixir, the elegant tongue,
Where functional purity is beautifully sung.
Through pipes and streams, data flows clean,
The most expressive code ever seen.

Jose Valim's creation, born from Erlang's might,
Brings Ruby's charm to concurrent light.
Phoenix Framework spreads its wings to the sky,
While LiveView makes interfaces come alive.

GenServer actors play their parts with grace,
Supervision trees keep errors in their place.
In this ecosystem of fault-tolerant art,
Elixir captures the developer's heart.
