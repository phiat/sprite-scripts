O Nim, you elegant creature of code,
Where Python's grace meets systems language load.
Your garbage collector dances so free,
While manual memory waits for decree.

Your compile-time magic bends reality,
Macros expand with such facility.
From embedded devices to web apps so bright,
You cross-compile with effortless might.

Your community small but passionate true,
Building libraries fresh and new.
In the landscape of languages vast and wide,
Nim, you stand with nothing to hide.
