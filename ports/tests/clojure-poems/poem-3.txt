Oh Clojure, you speak in parentheses,
A language of simplicity and power,
Where data becomes eternal, immutable,
And functions flow like pure mountain streams.

Your REPL breathes life into ideas,
Macros reshape reality itself,
On the JVM you dance with grace,
Bringing Lisp's wisdom to modern days.

No classes, no objects, just values and transformations,
A world where state is a choice, not a burden,
Where concurrency flows without fear,
And elegance reigns in every expression.
