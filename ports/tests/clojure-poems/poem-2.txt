A Lisp from New Jersey called Clojure grew bold,
With immutable data pure as gold,
No side effects here,
Just functions so clear,
Its REPL helps ideas unfold.

The JVM it calls home with great grace,
While macros give programs new space,
No mutable state,
Just patterns so great,
Rich Hickey's design finds its place.
