There once was a language called Rust,
Whose memory safety was a must.
The borrow checker would fight,
With all of its might,
Making lifetimes and ownership just.

Cargo builds with such grace and speed,
While threads run without fear or greed.
The compiler knows best,
Putting errors to rest,
For safe concurrent code we succeed!
