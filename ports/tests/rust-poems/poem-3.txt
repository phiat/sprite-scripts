Oh, Rust, you fearless warrior of code,
Where memory safety and speed both abound.
Your borrow checker stands as guardian bold,
While ownership dances with lifetimes profound.
No garbage collector needed here,
Just zero-cost abstractions so clear.
Cargo builds with the wind at your back,
Fearless concurrency keeps bugs on the track.
From Mozilla's forge to systems worldwide,
You compile confidence into every line,
Where C meets safety in perfect design,
Rust, the language where innovation resides.
