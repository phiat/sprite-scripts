There once was a language named Odin
Whose syntax was crisp and oddly codin'
It checks every type
Keeps builds and bugs in the right
And leaves runtime fears far behind Odin

There is a second quirk, a cheerful grin
As libraries grow wide and paths win
With tooling so fine
It ships code on time
And makes every coder feel at home in Odin
