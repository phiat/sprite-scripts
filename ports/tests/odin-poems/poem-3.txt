Odin, a quiet ode to the craft of code
You keep it simple, fast, and safe
Your types shield memory from drift and fault
Your ecosystem grows with crates and tools
Compilers cheer, runtime stays calm
Developers march forward, confident and brave
Your clarity invites teams to build together
Odin, you make hard problems feel doable
Long days end with clean, confident commits
