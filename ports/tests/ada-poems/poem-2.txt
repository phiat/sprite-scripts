A programmer named Ada once wrote
With syntax that made her note
"With semicolons and strict types
My code never takes hikes
Though the compiler makes me dote!"

The language so formal and grand
Was designed by a careful hand
For rockets and planes
Where bugs cause no pains
Ada code you can trust across land!
