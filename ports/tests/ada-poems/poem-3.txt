O Ada, language of precision and trust,
Born from the need for systems that never fail.
Your strong typing catches errors before they run,
Your tasking features dance in parallel grace.

From aviation to space exploration,
You guard the critical paths where lives depend.
Ravenscar profile, minimal yet complete,
Your design philosophy echoes through time.

Named for the first programmer, Lady Lovelace,
You carry her legacy of logical beauty.
In your formal verbs and rigid structure,
We find freedom from the chaos of bugs.
