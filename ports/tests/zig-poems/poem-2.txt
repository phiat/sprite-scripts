A Zig programmer named Sue
Had comptime dreams, fresh and new
With error unions so neat
And no hidden heap treat
She wrote code that was lightning-fast, too!

No hidden allocations, she swore
Made her programs cleaner than yore
Manual memory, she chose
While C interop arose
Her Zig code ran faster than before!
