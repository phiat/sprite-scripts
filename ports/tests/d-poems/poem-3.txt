O D, you elegant beast of systems and speed,
Where C++ meets Python in a passionate creed.
Your @safe attributes guard against memory's plight,
While ranges and algorithms make code feel so right.

From Walter Bright's vision to Andrei's design,
You compile to machine code, so pure and so fine.
Your mixins and templates bend logic to will,
Your modules import with such graceful skill.

Though some call you niche, misunderstood by the crowd,
Your performance and safety make developers proud.
In the realm of native tongues, you stand tall and true,
D programming language, we salute you.
