A coder named Drew loved his D,
With metaprogramming wild and free.
He'd template with glee,
Compile in a flash, you see,
But cursed when GC slowed his spree.

His D program ran like a dream,
Until the runtime made it scream.
"BetterC!" he'd shout,
Without a doubt,
Now his code flows like a steady stream.
