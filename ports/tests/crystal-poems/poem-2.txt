There once was a language called Crystal,
Whose speed would make Python men bristle.
With Ruby's sweet grace,
But compiled in place,
It ran like a fast-paced missile.

Its type checking strict, not so loose,
Would catch all your errors produce.
No runtime surprises,
With crystal-clear prizes,
Your code would be sharp as a spruce.
