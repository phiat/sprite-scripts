Crystal, bridge between two worlds,
Where Ruby's elegance meets C's raw speed.
You dance with type inference, smart and bold,
Catching errors before they plant their seed.

No runtime surprises plague your path,
Just pure performance, lightning fast and true.
LLVM compiles your beautiful math,
While keeping Ruby's soul shining through.

Static types without the pain,
Memory safe without the chains.
Crystal, you are freedom gained.
