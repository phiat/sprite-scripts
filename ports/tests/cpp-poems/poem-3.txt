O C++, you dance on the edge of machine and mind,
Where pointers pierce memory's veil,
And templates weave abstract dreams into binary reality.
You are the architect's chisel,
Carving systems from silicon thought,
RAII's promise whispered in every destructor's call.
From Stroustrup's vision to modern C++20,
You carry the weight of decades while reaching for tomorrow,
A language that trusts its programmers,
And rewards those who earn that trust with pure, unbridled speed.
