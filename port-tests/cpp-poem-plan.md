# Plan: Write Three Poems About C++

Write three short poems about the **C++ programming language** and save them as text files.

## Requirements

1. **poem-1.txt** — A haiku-style poem (4-8 lines) about C++
2. **poem-2.txt** — A limerick (2 stanzas) about C++'s quirks (templates, RAII, the STL, compile times, etc.)
3. **poem-3.txt** — A free-verse ode (8-12 lines) celebrating what makes C++ unique

Each poem must specifically reference C++, its features, history, or ecosystem.

## Completion

When all three poems are written, create a file called **done.txt** listing what was created.
