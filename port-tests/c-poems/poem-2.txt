A programmer named Tim wrote in C,
But his pointers went wild, you see.
He malloced with glee,
Then forgot to set free,
And crashed with a segfault spree.

His code ran for hours and days,
Through countless debugging malaise.
With valgrind in hand,
He found malloc's command,
And fixed that poor memory maze.
