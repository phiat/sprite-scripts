# Task: Write poems about Deno / TypeScript

This sprite was launched using the **Deno (TypeScript)** port of sprite-tool.

Write 3 short poems (8-16 lines each) about Deno and TypeScript. Save each to a separate file:

1. `poem-1.txt` — A haiku-style tribute to Deno/TypeScript
2. `poem-2.txt` — A limerick or humorous poem about Deno's quirks (permissions, URL imports, no node_modules, the dinosaur mascot, etc.)
3. `poem-3.txt` — A free-verse ode celebrating what makes Deno and TypeScript unique (type safety, web standards, secure by default, single executable, etc.)

Each poem should reference specific Deno/TypeScript features, syntax, or culture. Be creative and have fun with it.

When done, create a file called `done.txt` with the text "All poems written." and list the files you created.
