In the realm of JavaScript's chaos,
Deno emerges with purpose.
Type safety woven into its core,
Web standards as its foundation,
Secure by default, not after,
Single executable deployment,
No more package.json nightmares,
Just clean, typed, modern code.
The future of runtime is here,
And it speaks TypeScript fluently.
