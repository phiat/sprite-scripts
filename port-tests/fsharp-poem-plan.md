# Plan: Write Three Poems About F#

Write three short poems about the **F# programming language** and save them as text files.

## Requirements

1. **poem-1.txt** — A haiku-style poem (4-8 lines) about F#
2. **poem-2.txt** — A limerick (2 stanzas) about F#'s quirks (pipe operators, discriminated unions, immutability, etc.)
3. **poem-3.txt** — A free-verse ode (8-12 lines) celebrating what makes F# unique

Each poem must specifically reference F#, its features, history, or ecosystem.

## Completion

When all three poems are written, create a file called **done.txt** listing what was created.
