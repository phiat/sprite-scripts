A programmer from C++ land,
Wrote templates they couldn't understand.
With STL so great,
RAII sealed their fate,
But compile times were out of their hand.

The templates they wrote grew so deep,
While the linker and compiler would weep.
Yet the code ran so fast,
A marvel to cast,
From errors they'd constantly leap!
