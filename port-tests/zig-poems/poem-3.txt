In the realm where C and Zig meet,
There's no hidden control flow to defeat.
Manual memory, a sacred trust,
Comptime dreams turning to dust
Then rebuilt, faster, complete.

Error unions dance in the night,
No hidden allocations in sight.
Safety and speed, hand in hand,
Across all the system land,
Zig stands proud, shining so bright.
