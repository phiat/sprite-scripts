# Task: Write poems about Zig

This sprite was launched using the **Zig** port of sprite-tool.

Write 3 short poems (8-16 lines each) about the Zig programming language. Save each to a separate file:

1. `poem-1.txt` — A haiku-style tribute to Zig
2. `poem-2.txt` — A limerick or humorous poem about Zig's quirks (comptime, no hidden allocations, error unions, etc.)
3. `poem-3.txt` — A free-verse ode celebrating what makes Zig unique (no hidden control flow, manual memory management, interop with C, etc.)

Each poem should reference specific Zig features, syntax, or culture. Be creative and have fun with it.

When done, create a file called `done.txt` with the text "All poems written." and list the files you created.
